# Focus Mode for YouTube
A Firefox extension that gets rid of the distractions while watching youtube videos 

## Usage
This extension is extreme as it only allows you to watch youtube videos, no comments, no suggested videos (for the most part, see extra info), and the youtube search is redirected to duckduckgo.

## Install
Currently only available for Firefox (planned to be released for chromium browsers)

Check it out at the [Firefox addons store](link)

## Extra info
About suggested videos: youtube removed the ability to remove suggested videos from embedded links, however instead of recommending other youtube channel videos it recommends videos from the same channel.
